## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

# Description:

Guess-my-number: is a game where the program holds a secret number. and you try to guess it in the least tries.
the game is themed with a 80's arcade display:

- the user may click 'Again' to start a new game. <br/ >
- the secret number should be between 1 and 20, and it stays hidden ('?') until the user catches it correct. <br/ >
- the user gets 20 tries on each game. <br/ >
- the correct number will be revealed on a successful guess with an appropriate display! . <br/ >
- the game shows how many attempts the user is left with starting from 20. <br/ >
- the GOAL is to guess the number in the least attemts to get the highest score. <br/ >
- the current highscore is saved and updated with each result.
